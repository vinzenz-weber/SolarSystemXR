BEFORE YOU START:
- you need Unity 6.3
- you need URP SRP pipline 17.3 if you use higher please import 17.3 support pack.
- wind setup is in wind prefab at each scene

Step 1 - You can improve FPS amount by 30% if you change rendering path from forward+ to deferred+ at  PC Renderer setting
So if you need deferred Find File "PC_Renderer" and change Rendering path from forward+ to deferred+. Forward+ render is ok too but it's slower for big open scenes.

Step 2 - Setup Shadows and other render setups. Find File "PC_RPAsset" 
    - Change shadow distance to 150 or higher
	- Turn on "Opaque Texture" this will fix water translucency and distortion if its turned off
	- Turn on "Depth Texture" this will fix water visibility at playmode if its turned off
	- Optionaly use 1k or 2k shadow resolution. We used 2k.
	- Turn on HDR if its turned off

Step 3 Go to project settings: 
    - Player and set:  Color Space to Linear
    - Quality settings: Go to quality settings and: 
	     * turn turn off vsync
	     * lod bias should be around 1.5-2 and 1 for low end devices.
                        

Step 4 Find "Forest Demo Scene" and open it.

Step 5 - chose way of movement. Movie track or free movment.
	Chose camera and turn on or off "playable director" and "animation" or leave free camera movment turned on.

Step 6 - HIT PLAY!:)

About scene construction:
		- There is post process profile: Manage post process by scene post process object.
		- Prefab wind manage wind speed and direction at the scene
